# Project-03

The name of this project is Law Home Page. I have started this project at the end, after completing all 15 projects because HTML file was not available for this project. 
First I gave it a background color of brown color. Gave styles to navbar, this could be done using positioning but I have used flex box because it is fast and I am comfortable
with that. The project was easy and I have enjoyed it.
